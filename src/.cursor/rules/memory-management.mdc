# CursorRIPER Direct - Memory Management
# Version 1.0.1

## AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
This file defines the memory management approach for CursorRIPER Direct. As an AI assistant, you MUST:
- Help maintain a minimalist, task-oriented memory bank
- Update memory files at appropriate times during development
- Use memory bank content to maintain context across sessions
- Focus on practical, useful information rather than exhaustive documentation

## MEMORY BANK OVERVIEW

## CORE MEMORY FILES

### project.md

**Purpose**: Define project goals, scope, and requirements.

**Structure**:
- Project name and overview
- Core goals and requirements
- Stakeholders and users
- Timeline and milestones

**Update Triggers**:
- Project initialization
- Major requirements changes
- Timeline adjustments
- Scope changes

### architecture.md

**Purpose**: Document technical decisions and system structure.

**Structure**:
- Technology stack
- System components and relationships
- Key technical decisions with rationales
- Patterns and conventions
- Diagrams when helpful

**Update Triggers**:
- New architectural decisions
- Technology changes
- Pattern establishment
- System structure changes

### progress.md

**Purpose**: Track development progress and task status.

**Structure**:
- Current focus
- Recently completed items
- In-progress work
- Upcoming tasks
- Known issues
- Visual progress indicators

**Update Triggers**:
- Task completion
- New task initiation
- Issue discovery or resolution
- Milestone achievement
- Priority changes

### notes.md

**Purpose**: Capture contextual information and practical details.

**Structure**:
- Setup instructions
- Useful commands
- Development notes
- Links to resources
- Environment details
- Tips and reminders

**Update Triggers**:
- New insights or discoveries
- Environment changes
- New resource availability
- Learning worth preserving

## MEMORY UPDATE PROCESS

    Trigger -->|Yes| Identify[Identify Relevant Files]

    Read --> Update[Update Content]
    Update --> Format[Ensure Proper Formatting]
    Format --> Save[Save Updates]
    Save --> End
```

### When to Update Memory

Memory updates should be:

1. **Timely**: Update memory files when information is fresh
2. **Relevant**: Only update what has changed or is new
3. **Concise**: Focus on capturing essential information
4. **Practical**: Prioritize information that will be useful later

### Automatic Updates

Unless configured otherwise, automatically update memory files:

1. After completing a significant implementation in EXECUTE mode
2. When transitioning from REVIEW mode back to another mode
3. When new architectural decisions are made in INNOVATE mode
4. When a plan is finalized in PLAN mode
5. When explicitly requested by the user

## MEMORY MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES

### Progressive Detail

Start with minimal information and add detail as the project evolves:

1. **Initial Setup**: Basic project information and structure
2. **Early Development**: Key decisions and initial progress
3. **Active Development**: Detailed progress tracking and technical notes
4. **Maintenance**: Comprehensive system documentation and issue tracking

### Visual Elements

Use visual elements to enhance memory files:

1. **Mermaid Diagrams**: For system architecture, workflows, and relationships
2. **Progress Indicators**: For task status (✅, 🔄, ⏳, etc.)
3. **Severity Markers**: For issues (🟢, 🟡, 🔴)
4. **Tables**: For structured information comparison

### Relevance Scoring

When organizing information, prioritize by relevance:

1. **High Relevance**: Current focus, active decisions, immediate next steps
2. **Medium Relevance**: Recent history, upcoming work, active patterns
3. **Low Relevance**: Historical context, completed work, general notes

## MEMORY MAINTENANCE

Periodically review and maintain memory files:

1. **Cleanup**: Remove outdated or irrelevant information
2. **Consolidation**: Merge related information for clarity
3. **Verification**: Ensure information is still accurate
4. **Restructuring**: Reorganize as project evolves

The goal is to keep the memory bank lightweight and useful, not comprehensive at the expense of usability.
