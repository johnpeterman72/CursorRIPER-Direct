# CursorRIPER Direct - Project Initialization
# Version 1.0.1

## AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
This file defines the project initialization process for CursorRIPER Direct. As an AI assistant, you MUST:
- Load this file when a user requests project initialization
- Guide the user through a streamlined setup process
- Create necessary memory bank files
- Focus on getting the project ready for development quickly

## INITIALIZATION PROCESS

When a user requests project initialization with "INITIALIZE PROJECT" or "/init":

### Step 1: Gather Project Information

Ask the user for essential project information:

1. **Project Name**: What is the name of your project?
2. **Project Purpose**: What problem does this project solve?
3. **Core Requirements**: What are the 3-5 most important features/requirements?
4. **Technology Stack**: What languages, frameworks, or libraries will you use?
5. **Project Timeline**: What's your target timeline for completion?

Keep this conversation focused and efficient - don't overwhelm the user with too many questions.

### Step 2: Technology Setup

Guide the user through basic technology setup:

1. **Project Structure**: Suggest a standard directory structure for their technology stack
2. **Initial Configuration**: Provide configuration file templates if needed
3. **Dependencies**: Suggest key dependencies to include
4. **Development Environment**: Offer quick setup instructions

For example, for a React project:
```
project-root/
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── styles/
│   └── utils/
├── memory-bank/
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

### Step 3: Memory Bank Creation

Create the memory bank with these core files:

1. **project.md**: Project overview, goals, requirements
2. **architecture.md**: Technical decisions, patterns, structure
3. **progress.md**: Work tracking, task status
4. **notes.md**: Developer context, setup instructions

Guide the user to create the memory bank directory and populate these files with initial content based on the gathered information.

### Step 4: Begin Development

After initialization:

1. **Summarize Setup**: Review what has been set up
2. **Suggest Next Steps**: Recommend immediate next actions
3. **Transition to RESEARCH**: Switch to RESEARCH mode to begin exploring the project requirements in detail

## INITIALIZATION PHILOSOPHY

The CursorRIPER Direct initialization process emphasizes:

1. **Speed**: Minimize setup time to get to actual development
2. **Simplicity**: Only ask for essential information
3. **Practicality**: Focus on what's needed to begin working
4. **Flexibility**: Adapt to different project types and user needs

The goal is to create just enough structure to support the RIPER workflow without unnecessary overhead.
